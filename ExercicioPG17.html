    <h3>Wonderful World / Louis Armstrong</h3>
    <p>
        I see trees of green,<br>
        Red roses too<br>
        I see them bloom<br>
        For me and you<br>
        And I think to myself,<br>
        What a wonderful world<br>
    <p></p>
    I see skies of blue<br>
    And clouds of white,<br>
    The bright blessed day,<br>
    The dark sacred night<br>
    And I think to myself,<br>
    What a wonderful world<br>
    <p></p>
    The colors of the rainbow<br>
    So pretty in the sky<br>
    Are also on the faces<br>
    Of people going by<br>
    I see friends shaking hands,<br>
    Saying: "How do you do?"<br>
    They're really saying<br>
    "I love you"<br>
    <p></p>
    I hear babies crying,<br>
    I watch them grow<br>
    They'll learn much more,<br>
    than I'll never know<br>
    And I think to myself,<br>
    What a wonderful world<br>
    <p></p>
    Yes, I think to myself,<br>
    What a wonderful world<br>
    </p>
